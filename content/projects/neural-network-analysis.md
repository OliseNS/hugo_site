## Project Overview

This project examines the performance characteristics of various neural network architectures, focusing on loss function behavior during training, gradient propagation issues, and optimization techniques to improve convergence speed and model accuracy.

## Key Features

- Comparative analysis of different optimization algorithms (SGD, Adam, RMSProp)
- Investigation of various loss functions and their impact on model convergence
- Implementation of early stopping and learning rate scheduling techniques
- Visualization of training dynamics including loss landscapes

## Technologies Used

- TensorFlow/Keras
- PyTorch
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Plotly for visualization

## Results

The analysis revealed that adaptive learning rate methods like Adam consistently outperformed traditional SGD across different architectures. Learning rate scheduling showed significant improvements in final model accuracy by 5-7% compared to fixed learning rates.

## Future Work

Future research will focus on incorporating second-order optimization methods and exploring the relationship between network initialization strategies and convergence behavior.
