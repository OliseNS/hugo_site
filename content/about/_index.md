# My Coding Journey & Passion for Technology

*ðŸŒ± Planted: Jan 3, 2025 | ðŸ’§ Watered: Jan 3, 2025*

I started coding in my early years in Nigeria, captivated by how a few lines of code could bring something to life on the screen. Two and a half years ago, I moved to the U.S., bringing my passion for technology and a desire to make a difference.

Currently, I'm a junior at Southeastern Louisiana University, studying Computer Science with a focus on Data Science. I spend my time in the EEG research lab, collecting data and analyzing it. When I'm not in the lab, you'll find me skating around campus or working on personal projects.

As part of the leadership team at the International Student Union, I enjoy helping other international students adjust to life in the U.S. Having gone through it myself, I understand the challenges and excitement of adapting to a new culture. Whether itâ€™s explaining "crawfish boils" or showing them around campus, Iâ€™m always ready to lend a hand.

My love for technology extends beyond the classroom. During my internship at Dialysis Care Center, I worked with JavaScript and even built a chatbot! When I need a break, I scroll through funny cat memes or skate.

Outside of coding, youâ€™ll often find me:

- Working on projects in the EEG lab
- Skateboarding around campus
- Scrolling through reels or gaming
- Helping international students feel at home
- Contributing to my GitHub ([https://github.com/OliseNS](https://github.com/OliseNS))

I believe in technologyâ€™s power to connect people and improve lives. Whether Iâ€™m working on neural networks or building intuitive interfaces, Iâ€™m always excited to take on new challenges.
